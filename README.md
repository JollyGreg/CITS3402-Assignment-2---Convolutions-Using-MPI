./Convolution_stride -f "data/f_10x10" -g "data/g_3x3" -o "data/o_10x10 -H 10 -W 10 -kH 3 -kW 3 #generate matrix and save to the files given

./Convolution_stride -f "data/f_10x10" -g "data/g_3x3" -o "data/o_10x10 #load matrix from files and save to the output file

NOTE: I used a 1d array as the matrix just like flattening it out which apparently speeds up
